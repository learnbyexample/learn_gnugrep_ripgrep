```

**9)** Which option will you use if you have a file with a list of glob patterns to identify filenames to be excluded?

**10)** Does the glob pattern provided to `include` and `exclude` options match only the basename or the entire file path? Assume that recursive search is active.

**11)** How would you tell `grep` to avoid treating directory arguments as input files to be searched?

# Miscellaneous options

**1)** What do the `-q` and `-s` options do?

**2)** For the input file `sample.txt`, extract from the first occurrence of `Just` to the last occurrence of `it`. These terms can occur across different lines. Perform additional transformation to convert ASCII NUL characters, if any, to the newline character.

```bash
##### add your solution here
Just do-it
Believe it
```

**3)** For the input file `nul_separated`, use the ASCII NUL character as the *line* separator and display lines starting with `a`. Perform additional transformation to convert ASCII NUL characters, if any, to the newline character.

```bash
##### add your solution here
apple
fig
mango
icecream
```

**4)** Read about the `--line-buffered` option from the manual (read [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/q/7161821/4082052) too) and see it in action with code shown below:

```bash
$ for i in {1..5}; do seq 12; sleep 1; done | grep '[1-489]' | grep -v '0'

# '> ' is secondary prompt (PS2), not part of the command
$ for i in {1..5}; do seq 12; sleep 1; done | \
> grep --line-buffered '[1-489]' | grep -v '0'
```

**5)** Write a Bash script `find_digits.sh` that loops over filenames passed as arguments. For each file, search for the presence of a digit character and display the results in the format shown below.

```bash
$ bash find_digits.sh sample.txt patterns.txt regex_terms.txt
sample.txt: digit characters not found
patterns.txt: found digit characters
regex_terms.txt: found digit characters

$ bash find_digits.sh terms.txt lines.txt

```bash
##### add your solution here
S:4 and E:123
S:42 E:43
S:100 & E:10
```

**8)** From the `sample.txt` input file, extract all sequences made up of lowercase letters except those that start with `a` or `h` or `i` or `t`. Such sequences should not be surrounded by other word characters.

```bash
##### add your solution here
you
do
banana
papaya
mango
nothing
```

**9)** From the `sample.txt` input file, extract all sequences made up of lowercase letters except those that end with letters from `g` to `z`. Such sequences should not be surrounded by other word characters.

```bash
##### add your solution here
there
are
banana
papaya
he
he
```

**10)** From the `pcre.txt` input file, extract integer portion of floating-point numbers. Integers and numbers ending with `.` and no further digits should not be considered. For example, output for `ab32.4` should be `32` and numbers like `2.` and `456` should not be matched.

```bash
$ grep -oP '\d+\.\d+' pcre.txt
32.4
46.42

##### add your solution here
32
46
```

**11)** For the input file `pcre.txt`, filter lines that satisfy all of these rules:

* at least 2 alphabets
* at least 3 digits
* at least 1 special character among `%` or `*` or `#` or `$`
* should *not* contain `Yz` or `if`

```bash

F2H3u#9
A $ C1234
```

**12)** From the `pcre.txt` input file, extract from the second field to the second last field from rows having at least two columns considering `;` as the delimiter. For example, `b;c` should be extracted from `a;b;c;d` and a line containing less than two `;` characters shouldn't produce any output.

```bash
##### add your solution here
in;awe;b2b;3list
be;he;0;a;b
```

**13)** For the input file `pcre.txt`, match lines if it contains `qty` followed by `price` but not if there is any **whitespace** character or the string `error` between them.

```bash
##### add your solution here
23,qty,price,42
(qtyprice) (hi-there)
42\nqty-6,apple-56,price-234,error
```

**14)** From the `pcre.txt` input file, extract `if` followed by content within any number of nested parentheses.

```bash
##### add your solution here
if(3-(k*3+4)/12-(r+2/3))
if(a(b)c(d(e(f)1)2)3)
```

**15)** What does the `\G` anchor do?

**16)** From the `patterns.txt` input file, extract from `car` at the start of a line to the very next occurrence of `book` or `lie` in the file. Perform additional transformation to convert ASCII NUL characters, if any, to the newline character.

```bash
##### add your solution here
care
4*5]
a huge discarded pile of book
car
eden
rested replie
```

**17)** For the input file `patterns.txt`, match lines having the content present in the `p` shell variable literally at the end of lines. For example, if `p='*[5]'`, then `(9-2)*[5]` would be a valid match, but not `[4]*[5]+[6]`.

```bash
$ p='*[5]'
##### add your solution here
(9-2)*[5]

$ p='*4)'
##### add your solution here
12- (e+(j/k-3)*4)

$ p='42'
##### add your solution here
Hi42Bye nice1423 bad42
```

**18)** From the `patterns.txt` input file, extract all whole words if a line also contains `car`. But, any word occupying the first five characters in the line shouldn't be part of the output. For example, `no scar` shouldn't produce any output since both words have all/some characters within the first five characters in the line. `part cart mart` should produce `cart` and `mart` as output. `two sets tests` would fail the `car` condition, and thus shouldn't produce any output.

```bash
$ grep 'car' patterns.txt
scar
par car tar far Cart
care
a huge discarded pile of books
scare
car
part cart mart

##### add your solution here
tar
far
Cart
discarded
pile
of
books
cart
mart
```

**19)** What do the following unicode character sets match?

* `\p{L}`
* `\P{L}`
* `\p{Greek}`
* `\p{Xwd}`
* `\p{P}`

**20)** What do the following escape sequences do?

* `\A`
* `\z`
* `\Z`

# ripgrep

Would be a good idea to first redo all the exercises using `rg` from all the previous chapters. Some exercises will require reading the manual, as those options aren't covered in this book.

**1)** Which option will change the line separator from `\n` to `\r\n`?

```bash
# no output
$ rg -cx '' dos.txt

##### add your solution here
4
```

**2)** Default behavior of `ripgrep` changes depending on whether the output is redirected or not. Use appropriate option(s) to filter lines containing `are` from the `sample.txt` and `patterns.txt` input files and pipe the output to `tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'` to get results as shown below.

```bash
##### add your solution here
PATTERNS.TXT
12:CARE
15:SCARE

SAMPLE.TXT
4:HOW ARE YOU
```

**3)** Replace all occurrences of `].*[` with `_` for the input file `regex_terms.txt`.

```bash
##### add your solution here
^[c-k].*\W$
ly.
[A-Z_0-9]
```

**4)** For the input file `nul_separated`, use the ASCII NUL character as the *line* separator and display lines containing `fig`. Perform additional transformation to convert ASCII NUL characters, if any, to the newline character.

```bash
##### add your solution here
apple
fig
mango
icecream
```

**5)** For the input file `nul_separated`, replace the ASCII NUL character with a newline character, followed by `---` and another newline character.

```bash
##### add your solution here
apple
fig
mango
icecream
---
how are you
have a nice day
---
dragon unicorn centaur
```

**6)** Extract all whole words from the `sample.txt` input file. However, do not extract words if they contain any character present in the `ignore` shell variable.

```bash
$ ignore='aety'
##### add your solution here
World
Hi
How
do
Much
Adios

$ ignore='eosW'
##### add your solution here
Hi
it
it
banana
papaya
Much
```

**7)** How would you represent a `$` character literally when using the `-r` option?

**8)** From the `patterns.txt` input file, extract from `car` at the start of a line to the very next occurrence of `book` or `lie` in the file.

```bash
##### add your solution here
care
4*5]
a huge discarded pile of book
car
eden
rested replie
```

**9)** From the `pcre.txt` input file, extract from the second field to the second last field from rows having at least two columns considering `;` as the delimiter. For example, `b;c` should be extracted from `a;b;c;d` and a line containing less than two `;` characters shouldn't produce any output.

```bash
##### add your solution here
in;awe;b2b;3list
be;he;0;a;b
```

**10)** For the input file `python.md`, match all lines containing `python` irrespective of case, but not if it is part of code blocks that are bounded by triple backticks.

```bash
##### add your solution here
REPL is a good way to learn PYTHON for beginners.
python comes loaded with awesome methods. Enjoy learning pYtHoN.
```

>![info](../images/info.svg) For the rest of the exercises, use the `recursive_matching` directory that was created in an earlier chapter. Source the `recursive.sh` script if you haven't created this directory yet.
>
> ```bash
> # the 'recursive.sh' script is present in the 'exercises' directory
> $ source recursive.sh
> ```

**11)** List all files not containing `blue`. Hidden files should also be considered.

```bash
##### add your solution here
substitute.sh
backups/dot_files/.bash_aliases
backups/dot_files/.inputrc
projects/shell/hello.sh
projects/python/hello.py
```

**12)** List all the files in the `backups` directory, including links and hidden files.

```bash
##### add your solution here
backups/text/pat.txt
backups/color list.txt
backups/dot_files/.inputrc

```

**13)** What does the `-uuu` option mean?

**14)** Display lines containing a word ending with `e`. Search only among the `sh` file type and the output should not have line number or filename prefixes.

```bash
##### add your solution here
sed -i 's/search/replace/g' **/*.txt
```

**15)** List files other than hidden files and file types `sh` and `py`. Links should be considered for listing.

```bash
##### add your solution here
backups/text/pat.txt
backups/color list.txt
colors_2.txt
sample_file.txt
colors_1
```

**16)** List all files not containing a `.` character in their names. Ignore links.

```bash
##### add your solution here
colors_1
```

**17)** What does `**` mean when used with the `-g` option?

**18)** Search recursively and list the names of files that contain `Hello` or `blue`. Symbolic links should be searched as well. Do not search within `python` or `backups` directories.

```bash
##### add your solution here
colors_2.txt
sample_file.txt
colors_1
projects/shell/hello.sh
```

**19)** Match lines containing `Hello` or `red` only from files in the current hierarchy, i.e. don't search recursively. Symbolic links should be searched as well.

```bash
##### add your solution here
colors_2.txt
5:red

sample_file.txt
1:Hello World
```

**20)** Search recursively for files containing `blue`, `yellow` and `teal` anywhere in the file.

```bash
##### add your solution here
colors_1
```
